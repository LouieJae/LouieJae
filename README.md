👋 Hey there! I’m Louie Jae – your friendly neighborhood web wizard.
👀 Interests? Building sleek, fast, and functional web magic that people actually love to use.
🌱 Currently leveling up on Django and React – because the web never stops evolving, and neither do I.
💞️ Open to collaborating on projects that push boundaries and make the internet a more interesting place.
📫 How to reach me? Drop me a line, or better yet, find me on Facebook/LouieJaeMaravillosa and IG/@LforLowe.
😄 Pronouns: He/Him – or “Tech Genius,” if you’re feeling generous.
⚡ Fun fact: I can debug a website in my sleep (and sometimes have to).
